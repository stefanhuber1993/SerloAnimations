# SerloAnimations

The repository contains a jupyter notebook with code to create animated gifs of vectors to visualize linear transformations. I use matplotlib and imageio for plotting and writing the gif.

The code was used to make figures for this wikibooks book:
https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mathe_f%C3%BCr_Nicht-Freaks:_Lineare_Abbildungen,_Homomorphismus

Plans are to write this more nicely, transforming the spaghetti-code into some kind of object-oriented formulation, hopefully still flexible enough for other animations for "Mathe f√ºr Nicht-Freaks".
